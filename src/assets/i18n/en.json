The Umm al-Qura calendar is based on precise astronomical calculations to determine the beginnings of Hijri months, relying on the moment of sunset and the conjunction of the moon with the sun on the horizon of Mecca, making it one of the most accurate and regular calendars in the Islamic world. The website aims to provide an updated and easy-to-use digital version of the calendar, enabling users to view Hijri and Gregorian dates, prayer times, and Islamic occasions with high accuracy.",

    "extendedDescription": "The Umm al-Qura calendar distinguishes itself from other Hijri calendars with high astronomical accuracy and reliable religious reference, as it relies on precise calculations of sunset times and crescent conjunction, according to the horizon of Mecca, making it the closest to religious reality in determining the beginnings of Hijri months. This precise astronomical foundation, linked to the holiest places on earth, gives the calendar high credibility among official entities and religious institutions inside and outside the Kingdom.\n\nBecause we understand the importance of time in Muslims' lives, we have provided a comprehensive digital experience that facilitates access to the daily calendar, integrating both Hijri and Gregorian dates, displaying prayer times, and important Islamic occasions in a flexible and smooth manner. The interface has been designed to be compatible with all smart devices, allowing users to browse the calendar quickly and easily without complexity.\n\nThe Umm al-Qura calendar is also distinguished as the main reference upon which religious times and rituals in the Kingdom are built, starting from the entry of the blessed month of Ramadan, through Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, to determining the days of Hajj. This official approval reflects the trust the calendar enjoys and its central role in regulating time in accordance with Islamic law.\n\nThe Umm al-Qura calendar is not just a calendar, but an accurate and reliable time system that embodies the connection between science and religion, between astronomy and worship, serving everyone who seeks to adhere to religious times in their daily lives.",
